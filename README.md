# Earthquake Data Warehouse Project (2020-2025)

## Overview

This comprehensive data warehousing project processes earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API, transforming raw seismic data into a structured data warehouse optimized for analysis and visualization. The pipeline covers the complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process with additional AI-powered analysis capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The pipeline follows a multi-layered architecture:

```
Raw Data (USGS API) → Staging → Reconciled DB → Star Schema DW → Analysis & Visualization
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas geopandas requests certifi shapely python-dotenv groq
  ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

2. Set up PostgreSQL databases:
   ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA reconciledDB;
   CREATE SCHEMA earthquakeDW;
   ```

## 📊 Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Extraction (`Earthquake-Data-Pipeline.py`)

**Purpose**: Extract earthquake data from USGS API and perform initial processing.

**Key Features**:
- Fetches earthquake data for 2020-2025 from USGS API
- Processes location data with geographic parsing
- Adds county information using spatial joins
- Enriches data with US regional classifications
- Outputs clean, structured CSV files

**Usage**:
```python
from earthquake_pipeline import EarthquakeDataPipeline

pipeline = EarthquakeDataPipeline()
final_df = pipeline.run_pipeline()
```

**Outputs**:
- `earthquakes[2020-2025].csv` - Raw earthquake data
- `Earthquake[2020-2025]-Transformed.csv` - Cleaned and transformed data
- `Earthquake_with_Counties.csv` - Data with county information
- `Earthquake[2020-2025]USA.csv` - Final processed dataset

### 2. Staging Layer (`stagingEvents.sql`)

**Purpose**: Create initial staging table for raw data ingestion.

**Schema**: Single denormalized table with all earthquake attributes including:
- Event identifiers and timestamps
- Location data (coordinates, place descriptions)
- Magnitude and depth measurements
- Data quality metrics
- Source information

**Usage**:
```sql
\i stagingEvents.sql
-- Then load CSV data into staging_events table
```

### 3. Reconciled Database (`reconciled.sql` + `populate_reconciled.sql`)

**Purpose**: Normalize staging data into a 3NF relational structure.

**Schema Design**:
- **earthquake**: Core fact table with event details
- **location**: Geographic information and place descriptions
- **magnitude_detail**: Magnitude measurements and metadata
- **seismic_metrics**: Data quality and network metrics
- **data_source**: Source network and attribution

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Create schema
\i reconciled.sql

-- Populate with data
\i populate_reconciled.sql
```

### 4. Data Warehouse (`starSchema.sql` + `ETL.sql`)

**Purpose**: Transform reconciled data into star schema for analytical queries.

**Star Schema Design**:

#### Dimension Tables:
- **time_dim**: Temporal attributes (year, quarter, month, day)
- **location_dim**: Geographic hierarchy (region → state → county → locality)
- **magnitude_type_dim**: Magnitude measurement types
- **data_source_dim**: Data source networks and attribution
- **status_dim**: Event status and type classifications

#### Fact Table:
- **earthquake_fact**: Core measurements (magnitude, depth) with foreign keys to dimensions

**Benefits**:
- Optimized for OLAP operations
- Supports drill-down/roll-up analysis
- Efficient aggregation queries
- Simplified business intelligence integration

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Create star schema
\i starSchema.sql

-- Run ETL process
\i ETL.sql
```

### 5. AI-Powered Analysis (`LLM-Assistant.py`)

**Purpose**: Leverage Large Language Models for intelligent data analysis and insights.

**Features**:
- Automated dataset analysis and profiling
- Natural language insights generation
- Tableau dashboard recommendations
- OLAP functionality suggestions
- Statistical analysis and pattern recognition

**Usage**:
```python
python LLM-Assistant.py
```

**Capabilities**:
- **Dataset Profiling**: Automatic analysis of data quality, distributions, and patterns
- **Insight Generation**: AI-powered identification of trends and anomalies
- **Visualization Recommendations**: Specific Tableau dashboard suggestions
- **OLAP Analysis**: Roll-up, drill-down, and slice-and-dice recommendations
